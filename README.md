## Team

@Doug @Claire @Tyler

## Problem

We are solving the problem of not having on hand a playlist that fits the users mood in the moment. With this product users will not be left without tunes to match their feelings. Sometimes you just want to vibe without doing the work.

## Goals

What should customer be able to do when this initiative is 'done?'
Users will be able to...

1. Input their name
2. Input their mood
3. Input the amount of time they have available to listen

4. Get an auto generated playlist from YouTube based on their mood input with a correlating background picture on the dashboard.

And One Day...
